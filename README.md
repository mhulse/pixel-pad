# Pixel pad

Printable pixel grid.

This is a work in progress.

## PDFs

There are two options for printing:

1. Front-side
2. Back-side

Each option has room for spiral binding at the top of the page.

### Front-side print

For opaque paper.

### Back-side print

For vellum paper.

I recommend at least 30 pound vellum paper when using the mirrored version.

## Printing

**Screw Kinkos/FedEx office!** I’m sorry, but they suck.

I’ve had great service at Office Depot Copy & Print shops.

This vellum worked great for my needs:

## Example

To give you an example of what the reverse/vellum print looks like, here’s a show of Pixel Pad “version 1”:

I’ll eventually post an updated image that shows the latest Pixel Pad design.
