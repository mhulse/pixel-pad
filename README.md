**Printable 16-64 pixel grid.**

## PDFs

There are two options for printing:

1. Front-side
2. Back-side

Each option has room for spiral binding at the top of the page.

### Front-side print

For opaque paper.

### Back-side (mirrored) print

For vellum paper.

I recommend at least 30 pound vellum paper when using the mirrored version.

## Printing

I’ve had great service at Office Depot Copy & Print shops.

This vellum worked great for my needs:
